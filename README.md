# 🛡️ RPG Life Tracker

> Turn your daily habits into an RPG game. Gain XP, level up, and track your progress!

## 📖 About The Project
RPG Life Tracker is a Python-based CLI (Command Line Interface) application designed to gamify productivity. It allows users to define real-life tasks (like reading, coding, or exercising) as "Quests". Completing these quests rewards the user with XP (Experience Points), allowing them to level up their virtual avatar.

This project was created to practice core Python concepts:
* **Data Structures** (Dictionaries, Lists)
* **File Handling** (JSON for saving state, CSV for history)
* **Logic Implementation** (Leveling system, loops)
* **Data Analysis** (Pandas integration for activity logs)

## ⚙️ Features
* **Persistent Save System:** Your level and XP are saved automatically to a JSON file (`rpg_save.json`).
* **Quest System:** Pre-defined tasks with specific XP rewards.
* **Auto-Leveling:** Logic that calculates required XP and handles level-ups.
* **Activity History:** Logs every completed task with a timestamp (ready for analysis).

## 🛠️ Built With
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (for data handling)
* JSON & OS modules (Standard Library)
